# Weekly planner

## *What is it?* *Who can use?* 
This is an application for users to keep track on *weekly events* . Users can add their work to the day they choose.
They can check the completion of each event or mark if the task is completed or not. After one week, they can choose to
start a new week.
Every one including students, teachers who want to become efficient and need a planner to provide them a clear plan can 
use this application.

## *Why design this?*
A weekly planner is useful to increase the efficiency and helps people to be self-disciplined. I design the planner 
weekly because week is a suitable period for people to plan.
