# Weekly planner

## *What is it?* *Who can use?* 
This is an application for users to keep track on *weekly events* . Users can add their work to the day they choose.
They can check the completion of each event or mark if the task is completed or not. They can check the number of 
incomplete tasks for a whole week. After one week, they can choose to start a new week.
Every one including 
* students
* teachers
* workers 

every one who need to finish the work in the week unit and want to become efficient can use this application. 

## *Why design this?*
A weekly planner is useful to increase the efficiency and helps people to be self-disciplined. I design the planner 
weekly because week is a suitable period for people to plan. People can check their daily tasks through this application
and make a plan for the entire week.
